# Description

This project is a full stack prototypical web app using Python and Flask.
The front end will be built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc. to create a responsive and mobile-friendly user interface. 
The back end will include the web server, templates, stylesheets, and the database. 
MySQL will be used to create simple database tables and deploy the app with the database on a simulated production server.
The server is a mock reservation list that allows users to check reservation records and reserve a room.
